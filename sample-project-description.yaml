# SAMPLE PROJECT DESCRIPTION
# ==============================================================================
# This file defines your entire project for the Multi-Agent Development System.
# Agents (Architect, Planner, Backend, Frontend, QA, DevOps, Docs) read this
# file to understand what to build.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to "project-description.yaml" in your project root
# 2. Customize all sections for your specific project
# 3. Be as detailed as possible - agents use this as their source of truth
# 4. Run: python orchestrator.py --init to start the workflow

# END OF SAMPLE PROJECT DESCRIPTION
# ==============================================================================
# This is a comprehensive example. Your project may be simpler or more complex.
# Adjust as needed, but always be as specific as possible - clarity helps agents
# make better decisions and reduces ambiguity.
